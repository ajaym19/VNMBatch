	/*
	 * OOPS:
	 * is a paradigm with many features
	 * 4 main pillars of OOPS:
	 * 1.Inheritance
	 * 2.Polymorphism
	 * 3.Abstraction
	 * 4.Encapsulation
	 * 
	 * 1. Inheritance:
	 * 
	 * Students
	 * giveExams();
	 * takeBrek();
	 * eatLunch();
	 * 
	 * Teachers
	 * conductexams();
	 * takeBrek();
	 * eatLunch();
	 * 
	 * Staff
	 * hospitality()
	 * takeBrek();
	 * eatLunch();
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 100 Classes
	 * 10 Common methods
	 * 1 Method = 10 LOC
	 * common:
	 * 100*10 = 1000 Methods
	 * LOC
	 * 1000*10 = 10000 LOC
	 * 
	 * Parent Class:
	 * 10 Common methods
	 * 
	 * 100 Child class derived them from parent
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Polymorphism: multiple forms
	 * method will be present in parent and child class both
	 *  but preference will be always given to child class
	 *  2 types:
	 *  
	 *  1. Compile Time: achieved by Method Overloading
	 *  	Method Overloading can be done in 2 ways
	 *  		1. By changing the data type
	 *  		2. By changing the no of parameters 
	 *  2. Runtime: achieved by Method Overriding
	 *
